OVC2 Readme

1.  Intro
---------

OVC2 aims to be a light weight video chat program. This project is based on
the OVC (Open Video Chat) project started with the aim of bringing video chat
to the XO laptops. The goal of this project is the expand on that work and
provide a program that is efficient enough to run on all of the XOs already
out there. OVC2 also aims to bring sound support to the OVC project.

2.  Building
------------

At the moment, a normal GNU build should work (see the INSTALL file for way
more details that you probably want):

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

To actually run this program on an XO you will have to compile it for an XO.
This means you will probably need a chroot environment or pass lots of custom
library paths to the configure script. This will be worked out more concretely
as this project develops.

Since the new XOs are moving to an ARM based Linux, cross compiles are going
to be necessary for a non-native build. To learn how to do this, for now, hit
google up.
